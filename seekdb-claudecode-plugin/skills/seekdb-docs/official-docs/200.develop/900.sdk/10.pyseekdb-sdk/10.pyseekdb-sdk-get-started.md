# Get started

## pyseekdb

pyseekdb is a Python client provided by OceanBase Database. It allows you to connect to seekdb in embedded mode or remote mode, and supports connecting to seekdb in server mode or OceanBase Database.

:::tip
OceanBase Database is a fully self-developed, enterprise-level, native distributed database provided by OceanBase. It achieves financial-grade high availability on ordinary hardware and sets a new standard for automatic, lossless disaster recovery across cities with the "five IDCs across three regions" architecture. It also sets a new benchmark in the TPC-C standard test, with a single cluster scale exceeding 1,500 nodes. It is cloud-native, highly consistent, and highly compatible with Oracle and MySQL.
:::

pyseekdb is supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows. The supported database connection modes vary by operating system. For more information, see the table below.

| System | Embedded seekdb | Server mode seekdb | Server mode OceanBase Database |
|----|---|---|---|
| Linux | Supported | Supported | Supported |
| macOS | Not supported | Supported | Supported |
| Windows | Not supported | Supported | Supported |

For Linux system, when you install this client, it will also install seekdb in embedded mode, allowing you to directly connect to it to perform operations such as creating a database. Alternatively, you can choose to connect to a deployed seekdb or OceanBase Database in client/server mode.
