# Overview of vector search

This topic introduces the core concepts of vector databases and vector search.

seekdb supports dense float vectors with up to 16,000 dimensions, as well as sparse vectors. It supports various types of vector distance calculations, including Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance, inner product, and cosine distance. seekdb also supports the creation of HNSW/IVF-based vector indexes, as well as incremental updates and deletions, with these operations having no impact on recall rate.

seekdb vector search offers hybrid retrieval capabilities with scalar filtering. It also provides flexible access interfaces: you can use SQL via the MySQL protocol from clients in various programming languages, or access it using a Python SDK. In addition, seekdb is fully adapted to AI application development frameworks such as LlamaIndex, DB-GPT, and the AI application development platform Dify, offering better support for AI application development.

## Key concepts

### Unstructured data

Unstructured data is data that does not have a predefined data format or organizational structure. It typically includes data in forms such as text, images, audio, and video, as well as social media content, emails, and log files. Due to the complexity and diversity of unstructured data, processing it requires specific tools and techniques, such as natural language processing, image recognition, and machine learning.

### Vector

A vector is the projection of an object in a high-dimensional space. Mathematically, a vector is a floating-point array with the following characteristics:

* Each element in the array is a floating-point number that represents a dimension of the vector.

* The size, namely, the number of elements, of the vector array indicates the dimensionality of the entire vector space.

### Vector embedding

Vector embedding is the process of using a deep learning neural network to extract content and semantics from unstructured data such as images and videos, and convert them into feature vectors. Embedding technology maps original data from a high-dimensional space to a low-dimensional space and converts multimodal data with rich features into multi-dimensional vector data.

### Vector similarity search

In today's era of information explosion, users often need to quickly retrieve specific information from massive datasets. Whether it's online literature databases, e-commerce product catalogs, or rapidly growing multimedia content libraries, efficient retrieval systems are essential for locating content of interest. As data volumes continue to grow, traditional keyword-based search methods can no longer meet the demands for both accuracy and speed, giving rise to vector search technology. Vector similarity search uses feature extraction and vectorization techniques to convert unstructured data—such as text, images, and audio—into vectors. By applying similarity measurement methods to compare these vectors, it captures the deeper semantic meaning of the data. This approach delivers more precise and efficient search results, addressing the shortcomings of traditional search methods.

## Why seekdb vector search?

seekdb's vector search capabilities are built on its integrated multi-model capabilities, excelling in areas such as hybrid retrieval, high performance, high availability, cost efficiency, and data security.

### Hybrid retrieval

seekdb supports hybrid retrieval across multiple data types, including vector data, spatial data, document data, and scalar data. With support for various indexes such as vector indexes, spatial indexes, and full-text indexes, seekdb delivers exceptional performance in multi-model hybrid retrieval. It enables a single database to handle diverse storage and retrieval needs for applications.

### Scalability

seekdb vector search supports the storage and retrieval of massive amounts of vector data, meeting the requirements of large-scale vector data applications.

### High performance

seekdb vector search capabilities integrate the VSAG indexing algorithm library, which demonstrates outstanding performance on the 960-dimensional GIST dataset. In the ANN-Benchmarks tests, the VSAG library significantly outperformed other algorithms.

### High availability

seekdb vector search provides reliable data storage and access capabilities. For in-memory HNSW indexes, it ensures stable retrieval performance.

### Transactions

seekdb's transaction capabilities ensure the consistency and integrity of vector data. It also offers effective concurrency control and fault recovery mechanisms.

### Cost efficiency

seekdb's storage encoding and compression capabilities significantly reduce the storage space required for vectors, helping to lower application storage costs.

### Data security

seekdb already supports comprehensive enterprise-grade security features, including identity authentication and verification, access control, data encryption, monitoring and alerts, and security auditing. These features effectively ensure data security in vector search scenarios.

### Ease of use

seekdb vector search provides flexible access interfaces, enabling SQL access through MySQL protocol clients across various programming languages, as well as seamless integration via a Python SDK. Furthermore, seekdb has been optimized for AI application development frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex, offering better support for AI application development.

### Comprehensive toolset

seekdb features a comprehensive database toolset, supporting data development, migration, operations, diagnostics, and full lifecycle data management, safeguarding the development and maintenance of AI applications.

## Application scenarios

* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): RAG is an artificial intelligence (AI) framework that retrieves facts from external knowledge bases to provide the most accurate and latest information for Large Language Models (LLMs) and allow users to have an insight into the generation process of an LLM. RAG is commonly used in intelligent Q&A systems and knowledge bases.

* Personalized recommendation: The recommendation system can recommend items that users may be interested in based on their historical behavior and preferences. When a recommendation request is initiated, the system will calculate the similarity based on the characteristics of the user, and then return items that the user may be interested in as the recommendation results, such as recommended restaurants and scenic spots.

* Image search/Text search: An image/text search task aims to find results that are most similar to the specified image in a large-scale image/text database. The text/image features used in the search can be stored in a vector database, and efficient similarity calculation can be achieved based on high-performance index-based storage, thereby returning image/text results that match the search criteria. This applies to scenarios such as facial recognition.
