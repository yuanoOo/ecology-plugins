# Build a knowledge base desktop application based on seekdb

This tutorial guides you through building a MineKB (Mine Knowledge Base, personal local knowledge base) desktop application using seekdb, demonstrating how to implement intelligent Q&A through vector search and large language models.

## Overview

Core features of the application:
* Multi-project management: Supports creating multiple independent knowledge base projects.
* Document processing: Supports multiple formats such as TXT, MD, PDF, DOC, DOCX, and RTF, with automatic text extraction and vectorization.
* Intelligent search: Based on seekdb's vector indexes (HNSW), enabling efficient semantic search.
* Conversational Q&A: Query the knowledge base through AI conversations to obtain accurate answers based on document content.
* Local storage: All data is stored locally to protect privacy and security.

Reasons for choosing seekdb:
* Embedded deployment: Embedded as a library in the application, no independent service required.
* Native vector support: Built-in vector type and HNSW indexes, improving vector search performance by 10-100x.
* All-in-One: Supports transactions, analytics, and vector search simultaneously, meeting all requirements with one database.
* SQL interface: Standard SQL syntax, developer-friendly.

## Prerequisites

After obtaining the API key, fill it in the configuration file: `src-tauri/config.json`

```json
{
  "api": {
    "dashscope": {
      "api_key": "<sk-your-api-key-here>",
      "base_url": "https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/api/v1",
      "embedding_model": "text-embedding-v1",
      "chat_model": "qwen-plus"
    }
  },
  "database": {
    "path": "./mine_kb.db",
    "name": "mine_kb"
  }
}
```

## Run the application locally

### Step 1: Build and start

1. Clone the project and install dependencies.

    ```shell
    # Clone the project
    git clone https://github.com/ob-labs/mine-kb.git
    cd mine-kb

    # Install frontend dependencies
    npm install
    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install seekdb==0.0.1.dev4 -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple/
    ```

2. Configure the API key.

    ```shell
    cp src-tauri/config.example.json src-tauri/config.json
    # Edit the configuration file and fill in your API key
    nano src-tauri/config.json
    ```

3. Start the application.

    ```shell
    npm run tauri:dev
    ```
    <!--![minekb-1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/seekdb/minekb-1.png)-->

When a user starts the MineKB application, the system executes the following initialization flow in sequence:
* Application initialization (see `src-tauri/src/main.rs` for code details)
  * Initialize the logging system
  * Determine the application data directory
  * Load the configuration file
  * Initialize the Python environment
  * Initialize the seekdb database
  * Initialize the database schema
  * Create application state
  * Start the Tauri application
* Frontend initialization (see `src/main.tsx` for code details)
  * Mount the React application
  * Call the list_projects command to get the project list
  * Render the project panel and conversation panel
  * Wait for user operations

### Step 2: Create a knowledge base

We recommend using seekdb documentation for testing. [Click here](https://github.com/oceanbase/seekdb-doc).

<!--![minekb-2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/seekdb/minekb-2.png)-->

After the user clicks the `Create Project` button, the system executes the following flow:
* Frontend interaction implementation
  * See `ProjectPanel.tsx` for code details
* Backend processing implementation
  * See `commands/projects.rs` for code details
* Database operations
  * See `services/project_service.rs` for code details
* Database layer (`seekdb_adapter.rs` → `Python Bridge` → `seekdb`), code as follows:
    ```shell
    # Python bridge receives command
    {
      "command": "execute",
      "params": {
        "sql": "INSERT INTO projects (...) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)",
        "values": ["uuid-here", "My Project", "Description", "active", 0, "2025-11-05T...", "2025-11-05T..."]
      }
    }

    # Convert to seekdb SQL
    cursor.execute("""
        INSERT INTO projects (id, name, description, status, document_count, created_at, updated_at)
        VALUES ('uuid-here', 'My Project', 'Description', 'active', 0, '2025-11-05T...', '2025-11-05T...')
    """)
    conn.commit()

    # Return success response
    {
      "status": "success",
      "data": null
    }
    ```

In summary, creating a knowledge base performs the following tasks:
1. Generate a unique project ID (UUID v4).
2. Validate the project name (non-empty, no duplicates).
3. Initialize the project status as Active.
4. Record creation time and update time.
5. Write project information to the `projects` table in seekdb.
6. Commit the transaction to ensure data persistence.
7. Return project information to the frontend.
8. Frontend updates the project list and displays the new project.

### Step 3: Start a conversation

<!--![minekb-3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/seekdb/minekb-3.png)-->

After the user enters a question in the dialog box, the system executes the following flow:
* Frontend sends message
  * See `ChatPanel.tsx` for code details
* Backend processing
  * See `commands/chat.rs` for code details
* Vector search
  * See `services/vector_db.rs` for code details
* LLM streaming call
  * See `services/llm_client.rs` for code details

In summary, starting a conversation performs the following tasks:
1. User enters a question.
2. Save the user message to the database.
3. Call Alibaba Cloud Bailian API to generate a query vector (1536-dimensional).
4. Execute vector search in seekdb (using HNSW index).
5. Get the top 20 most similar document chunks.
6. Calculate similarity scores and filter (threshold 0.3).
7. Use relevant documents as context.
8. Build a prompt (context + user question).
9. Streamingly call LLM to generate an answer.
10. Send the answer to the frontend in real-time for display.
11. Save the AI reply and source information to the database.
12. Update the last update time of the conversation.
