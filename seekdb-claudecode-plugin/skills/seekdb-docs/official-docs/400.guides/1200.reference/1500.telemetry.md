# Telemetry

seekdb contains a telemetry feature that is enabled by default. This feature anonymously collects information about how the product is used. These insights help us understand how users interact with seekdb, identify common issues, and continuously improve its features and user experience.

## Privacy protection

The telemetry feature automatically anonymizes sensitive data, such as IP addresses, using hashing. Only essential technical metrics are collectedn. No business data or personal user information is ever gathered.

## Manage telemetry

You can control whether telemetry is enabled by setting the `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` environment variable.

To disable telemetry:

```bash
export TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

To re-enable telemetry after disabling it:

```bash
export TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true
```

:::tip
Telemetry is enabled by default, so you only need to set this environment variable if you want to disable it.

## What telemetry collects

Telemetry gathers the following anonymized technical information:

* Version and deployment details: seekdb version and deployment method

* Host environment information: operating system version, CPU model, number of CPU cores, and memory size

* Resource specifications: memory allocated to seekdb, data disk and log disk capacity, and similar details

## How to view collected data

A local copy of the telemetry data is saved on your system. You can see exactly what seekdb has collected by checking the `run/telemetry.json` file in your deployment directory.
