# Create a user

For enterprise users, when deploying seekdb, it is recommended to use the admin user, or you can use other users. However, the user must have sudo privileges and be the owner of database-related directories. This topic describes how to create a regular user and set sudo privileges for the regular user.

1. Run the following commands to create the user group admin and create the user admin.

   ```shell
   [root@test001 ~]# useradd -U admin -d /home/admin -s /bin/bash
   [root@test001 ~]# chown -R admin:admin /home/admin
   ```

2. Run the following command to set a password for the admin account.

   ```shell
   [root@test001 ~]# passwd admin
   ```

3. Set sudo privileges for the admin account.

   Run the following command to open the `/etc/sudoers` file:

   ```shell
   [root@test001 ~]# vim /etc/sudoers
   ```

   Add the following content at the end of the `/etc/sudoers` file:

   ```shell
   ## Same thing without a password
   # %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
   admin       ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```
