# Pre-deployment configuration overview

To ensure that seekdb can be used effectively, you need to configure the operating system and installation environment as follows:

| Configuration item | Required | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ---- |
| [Create a user](300.create-regular-user.md) | <ul><li>For personal trial scenarios, you can use the root user.</li><li>For production environments, it is recommended to use a user with sudo privileges.</li></ul> | You can use a regular user with sudo privileges. |
| [Plan disks](400.plan-disks.md) | <ul><li>For personal trial scenarios, no configuration is required.</li><li>For production environments, it is recommended to configure.</li></ul>  | In production environments, it is recommended to use different disks for the log storage directory and data storage directory to avoid performance issues in high-pressure scenarios when both directories are planned on the same disk. |
| [Configure limits.conf](500.configure-limits-conf.md) | <ul><li>For personal trial scenarios, no configuration is required.</li><li>For production environments, configuration is required.</li></ul>  | Improves the stability and performance of the cluster during runtime. |
| [Configure sysctl.conf](600.configure-sysctl-conf.md) | <ul><li>For personal trial scenarios, no configuration is required.</li><li>For production environments, configuration is required.</li></ul>  | Improves Linux system performance, thereby improving seekdb performance. |
| [Disable the firewall and SELinux](700.disable-firewall-and-selinux.md) | <ul><li>For personal trial scenarios, no configuration is required.</li><li>For production environments, configuration is required.</li></ul>  | Prevents access to the database from being blocked. |
