# Deployment overview

seekdb provides two deployment modes. You can choose the appropriate deployment mode based on your business scenario.

* **Embedded mode**: seekdb runs as a "library" inside your application. It can easily run on various "endpoints", making it suitable for mobile application development, desktop application development, and application development on IoT and edge devices. In this mode, you can connect and manage seekdb through Python scripts or SDKs.

* **Server mode**: Uses single-machine deployment, suitable for CI/CD and testing. It is simple, has low operational costs, and the server starts quickly. In this mode, you can connect and manage seekdb through MySQL, OBClient, or SDKs.
