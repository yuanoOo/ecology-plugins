# Prepare servers

This section describes the number and specifications of servers required for deploying seekdb, as well as the software and hardware requirements for servers, including the operating system and BIOS settings.

## Server configuration requirements

Servers must meet the minimum configuration requirements shown in the following table.

| Product | Number of servers | Minimum configuration | Disk type |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| seekdb | 1 | 1 CPU core, 2 GB available memory | SSD storage |

:::info
  <ul>
    <li>The log disk must be at least 1 times the memory size, and the data disk must meet the storage requirements for the target data volume.</li>
    <li>The resource requirements listed here refer to the resources reserved for seekdb, not the total resources of the server itself.</li>
  </ul>
:::

## Hardware environment requirements

### Memory

Run the following command to check the memory:

```shell
free -g
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:            174          38           6           0         129         123
Swap:             0           0           0
```

Ensure that the available Mem value is sufficient to meet the configuration in the **Server configuration requirements** section above. If it is insufficient, you can try clearing the cache to free up some resources or replace the server.

Run the following command to clear the cache:

```shell
sudo sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3
# or
sudo echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
```

## Software environment requirements
