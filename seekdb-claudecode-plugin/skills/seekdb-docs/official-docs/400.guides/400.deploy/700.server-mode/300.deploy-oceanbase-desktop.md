## Procedure

### Windows

1. Install dependencies

   Installing OceanBase Desktop on Windows requires WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). WSL is a feature released by Microsoft in 2016 on the Windows 10 platform that enables users to run Linux executables in ELF format on Windows.

   WSL has released two generations: WSL 1 and WSL 2. WSL 1 implements a Linux compatibility layer that converts Linux system calls to Windows NT system calls. WSL 2 uses Windows Hyper-V functionality to run Linux virtual machines directly through virtualization technology, providing an experience closer to native Linux.

   :::tip
   WSL 2 is not an upgrade of WSL 1, so you do not need to install WSL 1 before installing WSL 2. OceanBase Desktop images can only use WSL 2.
   :::

   1. Check whether virtualization is enabled.

      Press [Win] + [Q] on your keyboard, search for **Task Manager**, and click to open it. Go to the **Performance** interface and view **CPU**. As shown in the following figure, if virtualization is enabled, the **Virtualization** field displays **Enabled**. If the **Virtualization** field displays **Disabled**, refer to the following steps to enable virtualization in BIOS.

      <!--![Virtualization](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.3.5/400.deploy/800.oceanbase-desktop/800.deploy-oceanbase-desktop-08.png)-->

   2. Enable motherboard virtualization.

      This section uses ThinkPad (a Lenovo brand) as an example to describe how to enter BIOS and enable motherboard virtualization. The operations for entering BIOS and enabling motherboard virtualization vary slightly for different computer brands. You can visit the official websites of your brand to view specific operations, such as [Dell](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/zh-cn/000195978/how-to-enable-or-disable-hardware-virtualization-on-dell-systems?lang=en), [Lenovo](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht500006-how-to-enable-virtualization-technology-on-lenovo-computers), [ThinkPad (a Lenovo brand)](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht500006-how-to-enable-virtualization-technology-on-lenovo-computers), [HP](https://support.hp.com/us-en/search?q=enable%20virtualization), or search for your computer model in a browser.

      1. Open the **Start** menu, click the **Power** button, and click **Restart**.

      2. After the computer restarts, immediately press the **F1** key on your keyboard to access BIOS settings.

      3. On the BIOS page, click the **Security** option, and then click **Security Virtualization** on the **Security** page.

      4. After entering the corresponding settings page, set the button after **Virtualization Technology** to **no**.

      5. After adjustment, click **Save and Exit** to save the changes and exit BIOS settings, and wait for the system to restart.
