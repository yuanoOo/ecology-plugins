# Quickly deploy seekdb in client/server mode

seekdb provides embedded mode and client/server mode. You can choose the appropriate deployment mode based on your business scenario. This topic introduces how to quickly deploy seekdb in client/server mode.

:::info
For information about using seekdb in embedded mode, see [Experience embedded seekdb](../50.embedded-mode/25.using-seekdb-in-python-sdk.md).
:::

## Deployment modes

seekdb provides flexible deployment modes that support everything from rapid prototyping to large-scale user workloads, meeting the full range of your application needs.

* Embedded mode

    seekdb embeds as a lightweight library installable with a single pip command, ideal for personal learning or prototyping, and can easily run on various end devices.

* Client/Server mode

    A lightweight and easy-to-use deployment mode recommended for both testing and production, delivering stable and efficient service.

  * SUSE / OpenSUSE 15.X or later (Linux kernel 3.10.0 or later)
  * openEuler 22.03 and 24.03 (Linux kernel 5.10.0 or later)
  * KylinOS V10
  * UOS 1020a/1021a/1021e/1001c
  * NFSChina 4.0 or later
  * Inspur KOS 5.8

* The minimum CPU requirement for the current environment is 1 core.

* The minimum available memory requirement for the current environment is 2 GB.
  
* You have installed a database connection tool (MySQL client or OBClient) in your environment.

* The user you are using has permission to execute sudo commands.

* Requirements for deploying using yum install:
  
  * You have installed the jq command-line tool in your environment and correctly configured systemd as the system and service manager.

* Requirements for deploying using Docker:
  
  * You have installed Docker and started the Docker service.

## Quickly deploy seekdb using yum install

1. Add the seekdb repository.
    
    ```shell
    [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/OceanBase.repo
    ```

2. Install seekdb.
   
    ```shell
    [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo yum install seekdb obclient
    ```

3. Start seekdb.

    ```shell
    [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo systemctl start seekdb
    ```

4. Check the startup status of seekdb.
   
    ```shell
    [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo systemctl status seekdb
    ```
    
    When the status shows `Service is ready`, seekdb has started successfully.

5. Connect to seekdb.

    ```shell
    mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -P2881 -A oceanbase
    ```

## Quickly deploy seekdb in a container environment

If Docker is installed and the Docker service is started in your environment, you can also deploy seekdb using Docker containers. For more information about Docker deployment, see [Deploy seekdb in a container environment](../../400.guides/400.deploy/700.server-mode/200.deploy-by-docker.md).

1. Start a seekdb instance directly.
    
    ```shell
    [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo docker run -d -p 2881:2881 oceanbase/seekdb
    ```
    :::info
      
      If pulling the Docker image fails, you can also pull the image from the quay.io or ghcr.io repository. Simply replace <code>oceanbase/seekdb</code> in the above command with <code>quay.io/oceanbase/seekdb</code> or <code>ghcr.io/oceanbase/seekdb</code>. For example, execute <code>sudo docker run -d -p 2881:2881 quay.io/oceanbase/seekdb</code> to pull the image from quay.io.

2. Connect to seekdb.

    ```shell
    mysql -h127.0.0.1 -uroot -P2881 -A oceanbase
    ```
